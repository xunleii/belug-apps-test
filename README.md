## About

TrueNAS is an excellent operating system for NAS management and has had a Kubernetes cluster built
in since the early versions of SCALE. To manage the "applications" deployed on it, you have to go
through the TrueCharts project - which is actually a very good initiative, in the continuity of
[k8s-at-home](https://k8s-at-home.com/).

However, as far as I know, only TrueNAS SCALE has an user interface to install these Helm charts
and I find their way to manage them too complex (too deep in the DRY mindset).  
With this in mind, Belug-Apps was born: to provide an alternative to TrueCharts, running on the
TrueNAS SCALE Kubernetes cluster and based on a user interface that can be used on any other
Kubernetes cluster *(which makes migrations more easier)*.

- Provides a dashboard to **see and manage your applications** (based on Helm charts) - *thanks to <https://kubeapps.dev/>*
- **Isolate all your configurations and workloads** into a virtual cluster - *thanks to <https://www.vcluster.com/>*
- **Install any Helm chart** you want, from any Helm repository on your TrueNAS SCALE instance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Although Belug-Apps was designed to be as agnostic as possible, it still requires some things:

- An input controller must be installed. I recommend using Traefik because I haven't tested any
others and the installation form was designed for it *(like the other TrueCharts applications)*.
- A dedicated DNS entry to access the dashboard.
- A valid SSL certificate. *It can probably work without one, but I recommend it for security reasons.*

### Install

The only way to install Belug-Apps is to use the TrueNAS Apps interface. TrueNAS provides excellent
documentation on [how to add a catalog](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaletutorials/apps/usingcatalogs/#adding-catalogs), 
but here is a TLDR:

- Go to your TrueNAS instance and open the **Apps** page.
- Click on the **Add Catalog** button at the top right of the **Manage Catalogs** tab.
- Fill in the **Add Catalog** form with the following values:
  - Catalog Name: `belug-apps`
  - Repository: `https://github.com/belug-apps/truecharts-catalog`
  - Preferred Trains: keep `stable` *(but if you want to try release-candidates, you can use `incubator`)*
  - Branch: keep `main`

Wait until the catalog is synchronized. Congratulations, you can now install Belug-Apps in the
**Available Applications** tab.

Finally, when Belug-Apps is installed, you can open the dashboard by clicking on *Open* on the
application card.

### Update

As with other TrueNAS SCALE applications, when a **new version** is out, you will receive an
update notification. You will be able to update it directly from the **Apps** page.
